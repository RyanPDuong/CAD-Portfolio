Got it 👍 Here’s a simple **Markdown file** you can hand to a first-time Git user (non-programmer friendly). I kept it clear, minimal, and practical:

# Beginner’s Guide to Git (For Non-Programmers)

Git is a tool to **save versions of your work**. Think of it like a time machine for your project folder.  
You use commands in a terminal (like PowerShell, Git Bash, or VS Code’s terminal).

---

## Moving Around Your Computer

- `cd [folder name]` → move **into a folder**  
  Example:  
  ```bash
  cd myproject
````

* `ls` → **list files** in the current folder
  (On PowerShell use `dir` instead.)

---

## Starting Git in a Folder

* `git init` → turn the folder into a Git project.
  Run this once inside the folder you want to track.
  It creates a hidden `.git` folder.

---

## Saving Changes (Committing)

1. **Add changes**

   ```bash
   git add .
   ```

   (the `.` means “add everything you changed”).

2. **Commit the changes** (like saving a snapshot)

   ```bash
   git commit -m "Your message here"
   ```

   Example:

   ```bash
   git commit -m "First draft of my notes"
   ```

---

## Checking What’s Going On

* `git status` → shows what has changed and what’s ready to save.
* `git log` → shows a history of your commits.

---

## Pushing to GitHub (Optional)

If you already connected the folder to GitHub:

```bash
git push origin main
```

---

## Tips for Beginners

* A **commit** is like saving a snapshot of your folder.
* You can make as many commits as you want.
* Don’t worry about breaking things — you can always go back.

Would you like me to also include **clone / pull / push** basics in that same file (so the user can share and update projects on GitHub), or should I keep it strictly to local Git usage for now?
